# Business Analyst Case Study: Multilingual Expansion in Insurance Services

_Designing an inclusive, scalable strategy to serve non-German-speaking customers across digital and service channels._

## Multilingual Expansion for Customer Service in Insurance

## Overview  
This project defined a multilingual customer service expansion strategy for an insurance company operating in Germany.  
It focused on enhancing accessibility for non-German-speaking customers by introducing English support first, followed by Spanish, Arabic, and Turkish.  
_Company and system names have been modified to protect confidentiality._

## Business Problem  
Germany has seen a rise in international professionals, students, and families who face language barriers when navigating legal and financial systems.  
Many non-German speakers struggle to manage insurance contracts, which reduces trust, adoption, and customer satisfaction.  
Competitors that do offer multilingual services typically do so at a premium. This created a unique opportunity to provide inclusive, affordable supportâ€”boosting brand loyalty and market share.

## My Role  
As Business Analyst, I was responsible for:

- Defining business goals and multilingual rollout roadmap  
- Supporting the business case with market and competitor research  
- Coordinating with Legal and Compliance to ensure regulatory alignment  
- Planning the phased implementation of AI-assisted and human-verified translations  
- Mapping stakeholder responsibilities across Support, Marketing, IT, and HR  
- Defining KPIs to track adoption, cost efficiency, and customer satisfaction  

## Tools and Methods  

- Strategic planning and roadmap design  
- Market analysis and competitive benchmarking  
- Legal risk coordination  
- Proposal and presentation development  
- Pilot planning and feedback loop design  
- Collaboration across departments (UX, HR, Legal, Marketing)

## Project Steps  

1. Researched language needs of non-German-speaking residents in Germany  
2. Benchmarked multilingual insurance offerings from competitors  
3. Defined MVP: English translation of website and customer service  
4. Proposed AI-assisted translation workflows with human validation  
5. Mapped internal language capabilities and training/hiring needs  
6. Aligned multilingual expansion with legal and compliance standards  
7. Designed a pilot rollout and customer feedback loop  
8. Identified next-phase languages and marketing adaptations  

## Customer Journey Map

This journey outlines how a non-German-speaking user interacts with the insurance company through the multilingual support channels.
